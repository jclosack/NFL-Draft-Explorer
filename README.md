# NFL-Draft-Explorer

These Python scripts and csv files were used to gather, clean and prepare the data for my NFL Draft Explorer Tableau dashboard located here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/james.losack#!/vizhome/NFLDraftExplorer/Dashboard

The final .csv file that contains all of the paths for each player was too large to upload it's entirety so I have just uploaded a slice of it to the csv_files folder.
