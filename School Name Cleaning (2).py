"""This script standardizes the college names across the players and college list.

The players .txt file contains the list of each draft pick from 1998 to 2019.
This file was downloaded from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/ . Additionally,
The College_List.csv file was generated from the "Wikipedia Scraping (1).py script
and contains the list of all the D1-D3 college football programs. Missing college
football programs are added, community colleges and international players are assigned
identified as well. This module saves 3 csv files, 1 with the joined college and player 
list, and one each for the cleaned college and player list.
